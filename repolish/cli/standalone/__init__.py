"""Standalone CLI apps for backwards compatibility.

DEPRECATED: This package is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version.
These standalone apps (repolish-link, repolish-debugger) are maintained only for
backwards compatibility. New code should use the main repolish CLI with subcommands
instead (e.g., `repolish link`, `repolish preview`).
