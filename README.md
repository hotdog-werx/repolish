# repolish

Maintain consistency across repositories

Repolish is a hybrid of templating and diff/patch systems, useful for
maintaining repo consistency while allowing local customizations. It uses
templates with placeholders that can be filled from a context, and regex
patterns to preserve existing local content in files.
