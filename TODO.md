## Fix non-serializable objects in structured log context

Running `repolish -vv` crashes when a log call passes a structured context value
(e.g. a Pydantic model, `Path`, or custom object) that the logging backend
cannot serialize. This surfaces repeatedly whenever new log events are added.

**Goal:** make verbose logging robust so `-vv` never raises a serialization
error regardless of what is passed as context.

**Options to investigate:**

- Fix in **hotlog**: add a fallback serializer (e.g. `repr()` / `str()`) for
  unknown types, similar to `json.dumps(default=str)`, so unserializable values
  degrade gracefully instead of crashing.
- Fix at **call sites**: audit log calls in repolish that pass rich objects and
  convert them to safe primitives before logging (e.g. `str(path)`,
  `model.model_dump()`).
- Likely the right long-term fix lives in hotlog, with call-site cleanups as a
  secondary hardening step.
