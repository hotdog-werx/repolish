Demo: keep this file committed so examples and tests can show deletions

This file is intentionally present to demonstrate how `repolish` can remove
files when a template requests their deletion. Keep it committed in the
example project so `--check` runs can illustrate the behavior.

Running `repolish --check` will report that this file would be removed.
Running `repolish` will delete it from the working tree (but not
from the git history).
